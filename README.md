# Car-Price-Prediction-Model-Using-Linear-Regression
In this project, a comprehensive approach was taken to develop a machine learning model for predicting the selling prices of used cars.

## Description:  
This project involves analyzing a dataset of car sell records, which contains thousands of entries. The aim is to clean the data, explore key statistical properties, visualize relationships, and remove outliers based on certain criteria. Various techniques are applied to understand the factors that influence car selling prices and the patterns in the data.

## Description of Dataset:
The dataset contains the following columns:

| name | year | selling_price | km_driven | fuel | seller_type | transmission | owner |
| ---- | ---- | ------------- | --------- | ---- | ----------- | ------------ | ----- |

### Description of Fields:
- **name**: Type or model of the car sold.
- **year**: The year the car was bought.
- **selling_price**: The selling price of the car.
- **km_driven**: Kilometers driven by the car.
- **fuel**: The type of fuel used by the car (petrol, diesel, CNG, LPG, electric).
- **seller_type**: Identifies if the seller is an individual or a dealer.
- **transmission**: Type of transmission (Automatic/Manual).
- **owner**: The number of previous owners of the car.

### Analysis Questions:
- **Q1**: Data cleaning by removing missing values.
- **Q2**: Descriptive statistics for unique names, seller types, transmissions, and owners.
- **Q3**: Visual analysis of factors affecting selling price.
- **Q4**: Detection and removal of outliers.

## Technologies Used:
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

## Requirements:
1. Python 3.x
2. Pandas
3. NumPy
4. Matplotlib
5. Seaborn
