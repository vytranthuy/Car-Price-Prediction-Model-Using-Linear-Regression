# Car-Price-Prediction-Model-Using-Linear-Regression
In this project, a comprehensive approach was taken to develop a machine learning model for predicting the selling prices of used cars.

## Description
This project focuses on two goals: training linear regression models to predict car selling prices and discussing data ethics issues. The first goal is achieved through a standard Data Science workflow, which includes data exploration, feature selection, model training, and performance evaluation. Additionally, the project analyzes how training data size and feature selection impact model performance. The second goal explores ethical concerns related to data presentation.

## Features
- **Data Import and Exploration**: Loaded and explored a cleaned car sell dataset, examining correlations between features and the selling price.
- **Feature Encoding**: Converted categorical features (seller_type, fuel, owner) into numerical values using `OrdinalEncoder` from `sklearn.preprocessing`.
- **Model Training**: Trained multiple linear regression models using various feature combinations and dataset sizes.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated the models using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.
- **Data Ethics Analysis**: Examined ethical concerns related to data presentation in visualizations.
